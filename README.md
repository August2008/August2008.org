Organization "We Remember August" was founded by Georgian immigrants living in the United States. The organization's mission is first and foremost to help families of military personnel killed in War of August 2008 against The Russian Federation.

<p>
These families receive financial assistance from the government but we believe that regardless of our whereabouts and political beleifs, anyone should be able to express their support, respect and gratitude to honor the families they left behind.

<p>
Anyone has the right to join the organization. Donations are voluntary. The organization provides full support for the collection, distribution and delivery to the complete transparency and accountability.
